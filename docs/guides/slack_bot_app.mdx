Guide for Creating a Slack Bot App with Composio and Setting Up Triggers


This guide will walk you through creating a Slack bot app using Composio and setting up triggers for specific events or commands.

Prerequisites

1:Slack Workspace: You need to have a Slack workspace where you have administrative privileges.
2:Composio Account: Sign up for an account on Composio (if required).
3:Basic Programming Knowledge: Familiarity with JavaScript and Node.js is beneficial.


Step 1: Create a Slack App

1:Go to the Slack API: Navigate to the Slack API apps page and click on Create New App.
2:Name Your App: Enter a name for your app and select the Slack workspace you want to install it to.
3:Configure App: After creating the app, you’ll be taken to the app’s settings page.


Step 2: Add Bot User

1:Bot User: In the Slack app settings, go to the Bot Users tab.
2:Add Bot User: Click on Add a Bot User and configure the username for your bot.
3:Save Changes: Make sure to save your changes.


Step 3: Set Up OAuth & Permissions

1:OAuth & Permissions: Go to the OAuth & Permissions tab.

2:Scopes: Add the necessary bot scopes. At a minimum, you might need:

 *chat:write
 *chat:write.public
 *channels:read
 *groups:read
 *im:read
 *mpim:read

3:Install App: Scroll up to the OAuth Tokens & Redirect URLs section and click Install App to Workspace. This will generate an OAuth access token which will be used to authenticate your bot.

Step 4: Create a Project with Composio

1:Log In to Composio: Go to Composio and log in to your account.
2:Create a New Project: Click on New Project and give it a name.
3:Add Slack Integration: In the project settings, add Slack integration. You will need to provide the OAuth access token generated from Slack.

Step 5: Develop Your Bot

1:Set Up Your Environment: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

2:Install Required Packages: Initialize your project and install the necessary packages:


npm init -y
npm install @slack/bolt
npm install composio-sdk

Create Your Bot Code:
Create an index.js file and add the following code:


const { App } = require('@slack/bolt');
const composio = require('composio-sdk');

const app = new App({
  token: process.env.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN,
  signingSecret: process.env.SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET
});

// Initialize Composio client
const composioClient = new composio.Client({
  apiKey: process.env.COMPOSIO_API_KEY
});

// Respond to a message
app.message('hello', async ({ message, say }) => {
  await say(`Hey there <@${message.user}>!`);
});

// Example trigger using Composio
app.event('message', async ({ event }) => {
  if (event.text.includes('trigger')) {
    const response = await composioClient.triggerEvent('your_trigger_id', { userId: event.user });
    console.log(response);
  }
});

(async () => {
  // Start the app
  await app.start(process.env.PORT || 3000);
  console.log('⚡️ Bolt app is running!');
})();

4:Set Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in your project directory and add:



SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-slack-bot-token
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-slack-signing-secret
COMPOSIO_API_KEY=your-composio-api-key
PORT=3000

5:Run Your Bot:

node index.js

Step 6: Set Up Triggers in Composio
1:Log In to Composio: Navigate to your project dashboard.
2:Create a New Trigger: Go to the triggers section and create a new trigger. Provide necessary details such as trigger name, type, and any parameters needed.
3:Link Trigger to Slack Event: Configure the trigger to be activated based on Slack events. This might involve providing event IDs or conditions based on the Slack message content.

Step 7: Test Your Bot

1:Invite Bot to Channels: Make sure your bot is invited to the channels where you want it to operate.
2:Test Commands: Send messages in Slack that should trigger the bot and observe the responses.
3:Check Logs: Monitor the console output and Composio dashboard for any logs or errors.
